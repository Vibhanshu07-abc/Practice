A paragraph is a distinct section of writing, typically consisting of several 
sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. 
It is used to organize a piece of writing 
and is usually set apart by an indent or a line break. 
A basic paragraph includes a topic sentence that introduces t
he main idea, supporting sentences that provide details, and often a concluding sentence. 
Key characteristics and structur
Single topic: Each paragraph should focus on one main idea or point.
Topic sentence: The first sentence often introduces the main idea that the rest of the paragra
ph will discuss.
Supporting sentences: These sentences provide evidence, examples, details, or explanations
 to support the topic sentence.
Concluding sentence: The final sentence often summarizes the point or serves as a t
ransition to the next paragraph.
Length: While there is no fixed length, paragraphs are often 70 to 150 words long,
 with 5 sentences being a common structure for a basic paragraph.
